      <p class="text-muted" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p class="text-muted" >It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

<p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Story: When the royal lion cub, Simba is born to Queen Sarabi and King Mufasa, animals in the forest rejoice at having a new heir. But their joy is short-lived when Mufasa dies trying to save little Simba’s life. Feeling guilty for being the cause of his father’s death Simba runs away from the forest. And now his evil uncle Scar takes over the throne.
  Review: 2019’s The Lion King is a ‘live action’ remake of the 1994 original animation flick which went on to become an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King will vouch for its strong emotional connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a lasting impression and of course the legendary soundtrack and background score.
  So does the 2019 version of Lion King match up? (In India, the film is releasing in four languages – English and also dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.) The big draw of course of the Hindi dubbed version is actor Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa and Aryan Khan as Simba. The father and son duo had earlier lent their voices to the Hindi dubbed version of The Incredibles in 2004.
  2019’s Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor. Everything you see on screen is etched out with spellbinding detailing and the visual finesse gives way to near perfection. Some scenes especially ones with the fire flies in the night, open starlit skies and expansive views of the forest look stunning. Where the visual appeal falls short is in the expressions and emotions on the faces, especially the eyes of the animals which the animated version had got so right. So while you do feel sad when Mufasa is killed, you are not particularly moved to tears like with the original. And while Scar looks evil, he is not menacing. Also though the film is thirty minutes lengthier it pretty much remains an almost scene by scene copy of the 1994 version, losing its potential to surprise and intrigue further.
  However, the principal voice cast is a delight – Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa is captivating from the word go, Aryan Khan shines as the young Simba – capturing every emotion perfectly. The scene where Simba speaks to his father’s reflection in the water, with Mufasa’s voice emanating from the sky stands out as a whole – visually and otherwise. Ashish Vidyarthi as Scar is particularly good, his voice adding the required dimension to the character.Perhaps to contextualize andgive it a local flavor Pumbaa (Sanjay Mishra) and Timon (Shreyas Talpade) speak in tapori hindi here – so there is a generous sprinkling of ‘Bhai’ ‘Jhakaas’ ‘ Apun’ ‘Bindass’. And the gang of hyenas speak in Bhojpuri.While it may connect with the audience and elucidate some laughs, it robs the classic film of some of its original flavor.
  Shreya Ghosal, Arman Malik and Sunayna Sarkar do a fine job with the Hindi renditions of the soundtrack. But for those who have reveled in the original 'Circle of Life', 'Can you feel the Love tonight' and 'Hakuna Matata' it may not match up totally. The background score by Hans Zimmer is one of the high points of the film.
  For those who haven’t seen the original, 'The Lion King' (2019) is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and technical genius and one’s catching it in Hindi will have Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan Khan adding their spark.</p>
